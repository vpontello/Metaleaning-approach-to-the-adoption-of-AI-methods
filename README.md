# Metaleaning-approach-to-the-adoption-of-AI-methods

The implementation of artificial intelligence methods (AI methods) is often not a trivial task. Especially for beginners it is a big challenge to find out a suitable AI method for a certain problem (Zschech et al., 2020, p. 228). Furthermore, a heuristic approach to selecting algorithms is often error-prone and suboptimal (Ali, Lee and Chung, 2017, p. 257). As a solution to this problem, a process model has been developed within CRISP-DM based on a metalearning approach. The model uses a criteria grid to characterize the problem, and based on these characteristics the process model is able to propose optimal AI methods as possible solutions. The model was evaluated by means of tasks from master data management and the observed results are justified and considered in the literature.
